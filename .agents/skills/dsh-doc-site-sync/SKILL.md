# Synchronizing the Documentation Site

> 适用范围：本技能只适用于真正存在文档网站、站点清单与生成器的仓库。本项目当前没有 `website/` 树，不运行任何 pnpm/VitePress 命令；`docs/` 文档、Agent Notes 与双语配对由本仓库自己的脚本门禁校验。

Keep repository Markdown as the only editable content source. Treat the website as a tested projection: a site manifest selects public pages, a projector rewrites them into a disposable generated tree, and a static-site builder (for example VitePress) builds that tree.

Repository translations follow the sibling pairing contract: English `foo.md`, Chinese `foo.zh.md`, and `foo.i18n.yaml` live together. Never create `zh-CN/` or other locale directories for website content. The site route trees are independent of that source layout: `foo.zh.md` projects to the root route and `foo.md` projects to the matching `/en/` route.

## Read the owning contracts

- Read your repository's documentation standard and use [dsh-doc-standards](../dsh-doc-standards/SKILL.md) when deciding where content belongs or changing product documentation prose.
- For an edited bilingual source, follow your repository's lightweight routine path and pairing contract; never invoke an extended translation workflow automatically.
- Read the current page-manifest type and entries before changing the manifest; do not rely on a remembered field set.
- Read your site builder's configuration before adding a new section, sidebar collection, locale, or top-level navigation item.

## Classify the change

- **Edit an already published page:** change only its canonical Markdown source. Do not touch the manifest unless its route or navigation metadata changes.
- **Publish a new page:** create it in its owning docs tier, then add one manifest entry.
- **Rename, move, or remove a page:** update the canonical file, manifest entry, and inbound repository links atomically. Remove stale manifest entries; the site check rejects missing sources.
- **Publish a generated catalog:** map the generated docs file, but change its generator or source metadata rather than editing the catalog by hand.
- **Change site structure:** update the manifest for ordinary pages; update the site builder configuration only when the existing sidebar, section, or locale model cannot express the change.

Never edit or commit generated, cache, or build output trees. Except for the site's own `AGENTS.md`, never add Markdown under the site directory; locale and route directories such as `website/zh-CN/`, `website/en/`, and `website/api/` are invalid source layouts. Keep generated catalogs under `docs/`, freshness-gate them there, and publish them through the manifest.

## Add or update a manifest entry

Set every page-manifest field deliberately:

- `source`: repository-relative canonical Markdown path. For a complete bilingual pair, derive the sibling `.zh.md`, the content locales, and counterpart aliases from the English `.md` path.
- `route`: public site path including the `.md` suffix.
- `label`: sidebar label, not necessarily the document H1.
- `sidebar`: reuse an existing collection unless the information architecture genuinely needs another one.
- `section`: reuse an existing section when possible. If adding one, also place it in the site builder's section ordering.
- `order`: stable order within the section.
- `sourceAliases`: optional additional repository paths that should resolve to this page when links are projected. It does not create another public route.

Use a mirrored-page entry only for a source that intentionally falls back to the same available language in both route trees. Convert that entry to a paired-page entry when its counterpart is added. Keep the manifest an explicit public allowlist. Do not publish RFCs, postmortems, testing guides, `AGENTS.md`, or maintainer workflows merely because they exist under `docs/`; add internal material only when the user explicitly expands what the site publishes.

## Preserve link behavior

Write normal repository-relative Markdown links in canonical docs. The projector applies these rules:

- A target present in the manifest becomes a site-relative route.
- An existing target outside the manifest becomes a GitHub source link, including supported line suffixes.
- An image is the exception: its file is copied into the generated tree and referenced from there, so the site serves it regardless of repository visibility. It must be a regular file inside the repository.
- External URLs, site-absolute URLs, email links, and fragment-only links remain unchanged.
- A missing repository-relative target fails projection instead of silently producing a broken link.
- Cross-page fragments use the English GitHub heading id as their canonical id. If an authored heading emits a different site-builder id, place an explicit `<a id="..."></a>` immediately before it; add generated aliases in the owning generator.

Do not write website-specific routes into canonical Markdown just to satisfy the site builder. Use `sourceAliases` for directory-style repository links that should resolve to a mapped index page.

## Preview and validate

If this repository later adds a site builder and manifest, run that builder's own preview and focused checks; do not invent pnpm scripts. The current documentation gates for this repository are:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-agent-notes.ps1
.\scripts\verify-translation-pairs.ps1
git diff --check
```

If Markdown link checks pass but a site build reports a missing fragment, follow the fragment-check source and target paths. Preserve the canonical English id with an explicit alias in authored Markdown or in the owning generator.

Use [dsh-pre-push-checks](../dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md) before pushing. Report the canonical files changed, manifest entries added or removed, public routes affected, and the exact checks run.

## Keep deployment separate

Synchronizing content into the site build does not publish it to the internet. Do not add GitHub Pages permissions, deployment workflows, custom domains, or public hosting unless the user explicitly requests deployment and confirms the hosting policy.
